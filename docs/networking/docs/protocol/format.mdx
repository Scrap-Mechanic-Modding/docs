# Format

Generic format for all packets

## Without compression
| Field Name | Field Type    | Notes                                                                                                                |
|------------|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Packet ID  | Unsigned Byte |                                                                                                                      |
| Data       | Variable      | Size is retrieved through Steam's networking functions. Data can be any length including zero, depends on packet ID. |

## With compression
Compression algorithm is LZ4 (https://github.com/lz4/lz4). When looking for LZ4 compressed blocks in memory - keep an eye out for the `0xF0` byte marking the beginning. It won't always be there but it's really common

| Field Name | Field Type    | Notes                                   |
|------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Packet ID  | Unsigned Byte |                                         |
| Data       | Variable      | Same as above but compressed using LZ4. |
